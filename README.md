# Base image for PHP Apps

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/larueli/php-base-image.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/larueli/php-base-image)

I wanted to have a base image for all my php web projects, suitable with openshift (**random uid inside container**).

Easily deploy your php apps to containers, no difficult php extensions to install or anything.
Just do

```
#Your own dockerfile for your project just needs something like this

FROM larueli/php-base-image:7.3

COPY . /var/www/html/

VOLUME /var/www/html/uploads

USER 0

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y optipng jpegoptim && apt-get autoremove -y && \
    echo "/usr/local/bin/php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction --allow-no-migration" > /docker-entrypoint-init.d/migrations.sh && \
    composer install --no-interaction --no-dev --no-ansi && composer dump-autoload --no-dev --classmap-authoritative && \
    chmod g=rwx -R /var/www/html
# last line very important : you have to allow full access the group root for openshift

USER 1420:0
```

You can put your scripts inside `/docker-entrypoint-init.d/`. They will be run at each container start.

Don't forget to add a `.dockerignore` in your project, for two reasons :
* size of your docker image
* docker cache validating
* **security secrets could be exposed via your files**

```
#.dockerignore
.git
/var
.env.*
.aws
```

## Fonctionnalities
* Based on php:apache
* Runs as non-root user.
    * Capable to run with a random user in the root group (compatible with OpenShift)
    * Port 8080 inside the container
* Composer installed
* PHP extensions from the base image and I added some
